This repo is a general dumping ground for my TODO list.  
It's DS/Wii stuff I want to emulate, inspired by [Shonumi's Edge of Emulation series](https://shonumi.github.io/articles.html).

## Nintendo DS
Infared:  
Pokewalker*  
Activity Meter  
Game to Game Communication (Pokemon BWB2W2)  

*Being worked on by @UnrealPowerz

Ni-Fi Devices:  
Wii  
Toyota Smart Navi  
Wappy Dog (I think? Might be audio based. Need to pick one up.)  
~~Pokepark Fishing Rally DS Kiosk~~ (Assuming the Download Play dump stops being hoarded... It'd be HLE unfortunately, as the devices themselves were either all destroyed or stuck in a PCi warehouse somewhere. No firmware dumps emerged in the gigaleak, to my knowledge. TODO: Verify that's true.)  

Slot-2 Devices/Option Paks:  
LLE of already emulated devices.  
Faceningscan  
Bayer Didget Glucometer  
Easy Piano Keyboard  
Beypoint Reader and Beypointer  
SmartStylus & SmartStylus 2 (Unreleased. Might still be supported in the code for Squeeballs)  
Ranger GPS System  
FM Radio Converters  
Max Media Dock  

Slot-1 Custom Hardware:  
Nintendo DS Digital TV Tuner  
Bluetooth Reciever to connect with the Nintendo Wireless Keyboard  
DS Direction Sensing Card  

Other Accessories:  
Megaman Starforce Wave Scanner (Connects via microphone jack of all things.)  

Internal Hardware:  
Pressure Sensitive Touch Screen (Original model only)  
Temperature Sensor
