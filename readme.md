This repo is a general dumping ground for my TODO list.  
It's DS/Wii stuff I want to emulate, inspired by [Shonumi's Edge of Emulation series](https://shonumi.github.io/articles.html).

## Nintendo DS
Infared:  
Pokewalker*  
Activity Meter  
Game to Game Communication (Pokemon BWB2W2)  

*Being worked on by @UnrealPowerz

Ni-Fi Devices:  
Wii  
Toyota Smart Navi  
~~Pokepark Fishing Rally DS Kiosk~~ (Assuming the Download Play dump stops being hoarded... It'd be HLE unfortunately, as the devices themselves were either all destroyed or stuck in a PCi warehouse somewhere. No firmware dumps emerged in the gigaleak, to my knowledge. TODO: Verify that's true.)  

Slot-2 Devices/Option Paks:  
LLE of already emulated devices.  
Faceningscan  
Bayer Didget Glucometer  
Easy Piano Keyboard  
Beypoint Reader and Beypointer  
SmartStylus & SmartStylus 2 (Unreleased. Might still be supported in the code for Squeeballs)  
Ranger GPS System  
FM Radio Converters  
Max Media Dock  
DS Motion Pak (Slot-2 Version of the Motion Card. https://web.archive.org/web/20080503100321/http://ndsmotion.com/ )

Slot-1 Custom Hardware:  
Nintendo DS Digital TV Tuner  
Bluetooth Reciever to connect with the Nintendo Wireless Keyboard  
DS Direction Sensing Card  
DS Motion Card (Homebrew version of the above. Potentially cloned by some flash cards. https://web.archive.org/web/20070105053630/http://www.ndsmotion.com/ )  
DSVision  
Action Replay Variants  
Supercard DSTwo

Other Accessories:  
Megaman Starforce Wave Scanner (Connects via microphone jack of all things.)  
Wappy Dog (Microphone picks up audio tones emitted by the DS and reacts accordingly. Potentially transmits back to the DS via its own speakers and the system's microphone. Technically compatible with emulators running at proper speeds, but a LLE solution would be better for long term preservation. More details can be found at https://patents.google.com/patent/US8814627B2/en )  

Internal Hardware:  
Pressure Sensitive Touch Screen (Original model only)  
Temperature Sensor  
DS-TV-OUT  (..Might as well?)
