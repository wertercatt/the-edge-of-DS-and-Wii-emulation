This repo is a general dumping ground for my TODO list.  
It's DS/Wii stuff I want to emulate, inspired by [Shonumi's Edge of Emulation series](https://shonumi.github.io/articles.html).

Wappy Dog (I think? Might be audio based. Need to pick one up.)  
~~Pokepark Fishing Rally DS Kiosk~~ (Assuming the Download Play dump stops being hoarded... It'd be HLE unfortunately, as the devices themselves were either all destroyed or stuck in a PCi warehouse somewhere. No firmware dumps emerged in the gigaleak, to my knowledge. TODO: Verify that's true.)
